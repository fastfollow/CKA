# Two basic deployment strategies:  
# all strategies are working via creation of new replicaset under the hood for possible rollback

RECREATE (not defaut)
1. Destroy old
2. Application is down
3. New deployed

ROLLING UPDATE (default)
1. Destroy one-by-obe
2. Deploy one-by-one

Rolling update guide:
1. Fix deployment yaml
2. kubectl apply -f <file> || kubectl set image deployment/myapp-deployment nginx=nginx:1.9.1
3. Rolling Update starts

Event logs indicators:
1. RECREATE
1.1. Scaled up (new deployment) to replicas counter
1.2. Scaled down (old deployment) to replicas 0
2. ROLLING UPDATE
2.1. Scaled up new deployment to replicas counter
2.2. Old Scaled down by -1



Quick guide:
CREATE: kubectl create -f <file>
GET: kubectl get deployments
UPDATE: 
    1. kubectl apply -f <file>
    2. kubectl set image deployment/myapp-deployment nginx=nginx:<ver>
STATUS:
    1. kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp-deployment
    2. kubectl rollout history deployment/myapp-deployment
ROLLBACK
kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp-deployment
CHANGE STRATEGY:
kubectl edit deployment <name> -> spec: strategy: type: Recreate 
or via yaml and apply
